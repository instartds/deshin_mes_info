     *      static get declarable() {
     *          return ['extra'];

             * A class property getter for the configuration properties of the class, which can be overridden by
             * configurations passed at construction time.
             *
             * Unlike a normal `static` property, this property is only ever used for the class that defines it (as in,
             * `hasOwnProperty`). It is retrieved for all classes in a class hierarchy, to gather their configs
             * individually and then combine them with those of derived classes.
             *
             * For example, a `Label` might declare a `text` config like so:
             * ```javascript
             *  class Label extends Base {
             *      static get configurable() {
             *          return {
             *              text : null
             *          };
             *      }
             *  }
             * ```
             * The `text` config is automatically inherited by classes derived from Label. By implementing
             * `get configurable()`, derived classes can change the default value of inherited configs, or define new
             * configs, or both.
             *
             * When a config property is declared in this way, the class author can also implement either of two
             * special methods that will be called when the config property is assigned a new value:
             *
             *  - `changeText()`
             *  - `updateText()`
             *
             * In the example above, the `Label` class could implement a `changeText()` method, an `updateText()`
             * method, or both. The generated property setter ensures these methods will be called when the `text`
             * property is assigned.
             *
             * The generated setter (for `text` in this example) performs the following steps:
             *
             *  - If the class defines a `changeText()` method, call it passing the new value and the current value:
             *    `changeText(newText, oldText)`.<br>
             *    Then:
             *    * If `changeText()` exits without returning a value (i.e., `undefined`), exit and do nothing
             *      further. The assumption is that the changer method has done all that is required.
             *    * Otherwise, the return value of `changeText()` replaces the incoming value passed to the setter.
             *  - If the new value (or the value returned by `changeText()`) is `!==` to the current value:
             *    * Update the stored config value in `this._text`.
             *    * If the class defines an `updateText()` method, call it passing the new value and the previous value.
             *      `updateText(newText, oldText)`
             *
             * #### Resolving a value from an owner
             * By specifying a value starting with `'up.'` for a config, the config system will resolve that value by
             * examining the ownership hierarchy. It will walk up the hierarchy looking for a property matching the name
             * (or dot separated path) after 'up.'. If one is found, the value will be read and used as the initial
             * value.
             *
             * ```javascript
             * class Parent extends Base {
             *     static get configurable() {
             *         return [
             *           'importantValue'
             *         ]
             *     }
             * }
             *
             * class Child extends Base {
             *     static get configurable() {
             *         return [
             *           'value'
             *         ]
             *     }
             * }
             *
             * const parent = new Parent({
             *     importantValue : 123
             * });
             *
             * const child = new Child({
             *     owner : parent,
             *     // Will be resolved from the owner
             *     value : 'up.importantValue'
             * });
             *
             * console.log(child.value); // logs 123
             * ```

             * Please note that this is for now a one way one time binding, the value will only be read initially and
             * not kept up to date on later changes.
             *
             * #### Value Merging
             * When a config property value is an object, the value declared by the base class is merged with values
             * declared by derived classes and the value passed to the constructor.
             * ```javascript
             *  class Example extends Base {
             *      static get configurable() {
             *          return {
             *              config : {
             *                  foo : 1,
             *                  bar : 2
             *              }
             *          };
             *      }
             *  }
             *
             *  class Example2 extends Example {
             *      static get configurable() {
             *          return {
             *              config : {
             *                  bar : 42,
             *                  zip : 'abc'
             *              }
             *          };
             *      }
             *  }
             *
             *  let ex = new Example2({
             *      config : {
             *          zip : 'xyz'
             *      }
             *  });
             * ```
             * The result of the merge would set `config` to:
             * ```javascript
             *  ex.foo = {
             *      foo : 1,    // from Example
             *      bar : 42,   // from Example2
             *      zip : 'xyz' // from constructor
             *  }
             * ```
             *
             * #### Config Options
             * Some config properties require additional options such as declarative information about the config that
             * may be useful to automate some operation. Consider a `Button`. It could declare that its `text` config
             * affects the rendered HTML by applying a `render` property to the config definition. Its base class could
             * then examine the config definition to find this property.
             *
             * To support this, config options ca be declared like so:
             * ```javascript
             *  class Button extends Widget {
             *      static get configurable() {
             *          return {
             *              text : {
             *                  value   : null,
             *                  $config : {
             *                      render : true
             *                  }
             *              }
             *          };
             *      }
             *  }
             * ```
             * The `$config` property can alternatively be just the names of the options that should be enabled (set
             * to `true`).
             *
             * For example, the following is equivalent to the above:
             * ```javascript
             *  class Button extends Widget {
             *      static get configurable() {
             *          return {
             *              text : {
             *                  value   : null,
             *                  $config : 'render'
             *              }
             *          };
             *  }
             * ```
             *
             * #### Default Value
             * It is common to set a config to a `null` value to take advantage of internal optimizations for `null`
             * values. In most cases the fact that this produces `undefined` as the actual initial value of the config
             * is acceptable. When this is not acceptable, a config can be declared like so:
             * ```javascript
             *  class Widget {
             *      static get configurable() {
             *          return {
             *              disabled : {
             *                  $config : null,
             *                  value   : null,
             *                  default : false
             *              }
             *          };
             *  }
             * ```
             * The `default` property above determines the value of the config while still gaining the benefits of
             * minimal processing due to the `null` value of the `value` property.
